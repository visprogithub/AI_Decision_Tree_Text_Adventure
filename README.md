# AI Implementation Decision Tree

An interactive guide to help developers and architects choose the right AI implementation approach for their projects.

## Overview

This decision tree tool helps you navigate the complex landscape of AI implementation options, from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to Multi-Agent Systems. Simply answer questions about your project needs to get tailored recommendations.

## Features

- Interactive decision tree navigation
- Detailed explanations for each AI approach
- Real-world examples and use cases
- Implementation guidance with specific tools
- Cloud provider options (AWS, Azure, alternatives)

## Key Decision Paths

1. **Document Search & Answers**
   - RAG (unstructured text)
   - Function Calling (structured data)
   - Hybrid RAG (mixed data types)
   - Graph RAG (relationship-based)
   - Agentic RAG (adaptive retrieval)
   - CAG (cached responses)

2. **Process Automation**
   - API Chaining (1-2 steps)
   - Workflow Orchestration (3+ steps)
   - Hybrid AI (with decision-making)

3. **Content Generation**
   - Prompt Engineering (basic)
   - Validation Rules (structured output)
   - Fine-Tuning (domain-specific)
   - Multi-Model AI (complex)
   - Multi-Agent Systems (specialized roles)

4. **Decision Support**
   - Traditional ML (structured data)
   - Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (explanations)
   - Hybrid Approaches (mixed inputs)
